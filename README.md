### Description:
This project is a biased simulation designed to demonstrate how drastically bias can affect different kinds of people and their perspectives. It is important to emphasize from the beginning that this is only a simulation and not a reflection of real life. Because of that, the results produced here will inevitably differ from what we might observe in actual human societies. Still, I have attempted to make the simulation as realistic as possible by relying on a well-known mathematical and computational framework: the “Small World” model. This model is often used to represent groups of people and their connections, and it provides a useful way to explore how information, opinions, and biases spread through a network.

In the simulation, each node represents a person. Every node is able to read the data—or in this case, the “view on a subject”—of its neighbors within ten steps of itself. This means that individuals are not only influenced by their immediate friends or contacts but also by people who are somewhat further away in the network.

One of the most realistic parts of the model is the way it incorporates randomness. Out of the twenty connections each node has, there is a 10% chance that at least one of those connections will not be to a nearby neighbor but instead to a random location in the list. In the visualization, red lines represent these random, long-distance connections, while grey lines represent the more local, predictable ones. Most people have at least one friend, colleague, or acquaintance who lives far away, and these distant connections can have a large impact on how ideas and biases spread. The dots in the simulation represent people, and their colors represent their views on a random topic. For simplicity, I chose the scenario of dots wanting to be red or blue.

The goal of this simulation is to help people understand how our modern, hyperconnected world can lead to bias in our decisions. In today’s society, where information travels instantly across the globe, people are constantly influenced by both their local communities and their distant connections. By visualizing this in a simple, interactive way, I hope to make the concept of bias more tangible and easier to grasp.

In my folder, there are 4 files: one, the executable, two, the Python source code file, three, the README file, and four, the requirements.txt for requirements that are needed to run the regular Python file. I included the executable so that there would be an easy way to run this program. I made this on my Windows laptop. The file final_project.py is the source code that I designed in PyCharm, and I copied it into VSCode. I couldn't get the file to run itself in CS50.dev; however, this code does run in most codespaces by default without pip install. The third file is this README file. The fourth file is the requirements.txt file that can be used to help run the Python file itself in other Python environments.

As for the inspiration behind the code, my interest in this project began some time ago when I first learned about linked lists in Week 5 of the course. I had always been fascinated by neural networks and other networks, but after learning about linked lists, I became especially interested in how these structures could be applied to model societies. I became really interested in networks and created the node class, which I have used for several personal projects. When it came time to choose a final project, I wanted to build something that combined my interest in networks with my desire to create a tool that could be understood by anyone, regardless of their technical background.

A major source of inspiration was Veritasium’s video “We simulated if you can really reach anyone in 6 steps.” . It got me thinking about how computers can be used to simulate not just mathematical concepts but also real-world problems. I wanted to create something large enough to feel meaningful but also simple enough that anyone could immediately understand the point. This project is the result of that effort: a simulation that demonstrates, visually and intuitively, how bias can spread and shape the decisions we make in a connected world.

In the end, my project was a huge personal accomplishment for me because not only was I able to create something so complex in an easy way, with Python's easy syntax, but I was also able to create some meaningful and easy to use. I hope that by creating this simulation, people will not only have a newfound knowledge of just how powerful our connections are, but also for people to see how technology can help us spread useful information to others in a visual and user-friendly way, "pictures are worth 1000 words." This is my final project and this was cs50x.

### Usage:
This project was designed and tested in PyCharm, so I have included an executable so that anyone can run and view my project; however the python file itself works in almost any coding enviorment. Note, its reccomended you run this with the requirments.txt file in the same directory as the python file when you run it.
